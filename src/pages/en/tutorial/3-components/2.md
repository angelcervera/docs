<Goals>
  - added a new component that receives properties (props) passed by attribute
  - rendered this new component multiple times, each time receiving different props
  - styled this component
</Goals>

Now that you have used Astro components on a page, let's use a component within another component!

## Create a Social Media component

1. Create a new file at the location `src/components/Social.astro`.

2. Copy the following code into your new file, `Social.astro`.

    ```astro
    ---
    // src/components/Social.astro

    const {platform, username} = Astro.props
    ---
    <span><a href=`https://www.${platform}.com/${username}`>{platform}</a></span>
    ```

### Import and use `Social.astro` in your Footer

1. Change the code in `src/components/Footer.astro` to import, then render this new component three times, passing different **component attributes** as props each time:

    ```astro
    ---
    // src/components/Footer.astro

    import Social from './Social.astro'
    ---
    <Social platform="twitter" username="astrodotbuild" />
    <Social platform="github" username="withastro" />
    <Social platform="youtube" username="astrodotbuild" />
    ```

2. Check each page in your browser preview, and you should see your new footer rendering links to these three platforms.

## Analyze the pattern

1. What line of code do you need to write in an Astro component to **receive values** (e.g. `title`, `author`, and`description`) **as props**?

    || `const { title, author, description } = Astro.props` ||
    

2. How do you **send values as props** to an Astro component?

    || Write a **component attribute**, e.g. `<ProductList category="shoes" />` ||


## Style your components

1. Add the following `<style>` tag to `src/components/social`:

    ```astro
    ---
    // src/components/social.astro
    ---
    <style>
      .social-platform {
        margin: 0.4em;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: #ff9776;
        border-radius: 3px;
      }
      a {
        color: #00539F;
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    </style>
    ```

2. Add the following HTML element with a corresponding `<style>` tag to `src/components/footer.astro` to separate your footer from the rest of the page content. 

    ```astro title="src/components/footer.astro" ins={4-8,10}
    ---
    import Social from './Social.astro'
    ---
    <style>
       .spacer {
           height: 2em;
       }
    </style>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <Social platform="twitter" username="astrodotbuild" />
    <Social platform="github" username="withastro" />
    <Social platform="youtube" username="astrodotbuild" />
    ```

3. Check your browser preview again and confirm that each page shows an updated footer.

## Analyze the Pattern

1. How is your `<Footer />` component similar to your `<Navigation />` component? How is it different?

    || Both are Astro components, and both are written in the component template to provide some HTML that is defined elsewhere. The `<Footer />` component is itself further composed of more components. ||

2. Your website's footer and navigation each display three links. List three differences between these two sets of links. Think about things like _where the link text comes from_, _the appearance of the links on the page_ and _how the link's URL is determined_.

    || The website footer renders link text that is generated in another component; the navigation component renders link text that are typed in directly. ||

    || The website footer links are styled by a `<style>` tag in the social component; the navigation component links only have default and global styling applied. ||

    || The website footer links are generated dynamically using props passed as component attributes to another component; the navigation component uses link URLs that are typed in directly. ||

3. Describe how Astro uses **component-based design** to render a page and why this is useful.

    || Astro can render components within other components (**component-based design**) which allows you to compose HTML in independent, reusable pieces. This can make it easier to make changes or troubleshoot as you work, by helping you know more precisely where to look to find your specific code. ||

## Before you go

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="props">
- [ ] I can create new `.astro` components in `src/components/`
- [ ] I can import and render components inside other components.
- [ ] I can send data (pass props) as component attributes to an Astro component so that it can dynamically generate HTML.
</Checklist>
